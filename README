'trm.ultracam' is a Python module to provide access to raw and ucm
ULTRACAM data files, allow writing to FITS and the like. It is 
supposed to allow quick development of scripts, such as may be
needed to correct data problems.

Installation:

In addition to standard Python you need in approximately increasing 
probability that you will need to install something:

1) numpy      -- numerical Python library. 
2) matplotlib -- widely-used Python plotting library.
3) PyFITS     -- STScI-supported FITS libary.
4) ppgplot    -- less-used but faster plotting library
5) trm.subs   -- my own package of basic routines.

Install with the usual:

python setup.py install --prefix=your_top_level_installation_directory
