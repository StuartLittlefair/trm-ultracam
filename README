'trm.ultracam' is a Python module to provide access to raw ULTRACAM data
files.

Look in 'scripts' for some example scripts. This is a beta version 
and there may well be changes in the future, in particular to the 
currently crude way the headers are handled.

Installation:

As well as standard Python, you need 'numpy' (http://numpy.scipy.org/),

Install with the usual:

python setup.py install --prefix=your_top_level_installation_directory
